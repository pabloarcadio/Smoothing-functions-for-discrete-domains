These code files are of two kinds. First compile the different smoothing functions, some of them specially designed for working in discrete domains. 
The other files correspond to the pipelines that were created for the whole process of Image processing that goes from taking as an input the Berkeley Data set images, 
then the smoothing filters are applied, and the next steps are devoted to the edge detection method and its final evaluation. 
If any doubt about the process of working with the files you can consult to me directly at pflores@ucm.es

Kind regards and I hope this code could be eventualy useful for you.
